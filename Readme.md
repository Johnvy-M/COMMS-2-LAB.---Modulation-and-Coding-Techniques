## Introduction of the Emona Telecoms - Trainer 101
As its name implies, the Emona Telecons-Trainer 101 is used to help students learn about communications and telecommunications principles. It lets you bring to life the block diagrams that fill communications textbooks. A "block diagram" is a simplified representation of a more complex circuit. An example is shown in the Figure below.

## Experiment #1 - Setting up an Oscilloscope
Oscilloscope is arguably one of the most versatile and essential pieces of test equipment in the electronics industry. It gives a visual display of voltage so that its shape can be inspected. It also allows the user to measure a voltage's critical dimensions like its amplitude and period. To get the right data from the oscilloscope, it is important first to make the equipment callibrated and at the right settings, to ensure an accurate and correct data, also to eliminate unnecesary signals. This experiment focuses on the right procedure on how to set the oscilloscope crrectly. 

### Objectives: 
* Be familiar with few controls of the scopes 
* Know the procedure that will set up the scopes ready to show a stable 2Khz 4Vp-p signal on the scope's screem every time.
* View the AC signals

### Equipment
* Dual channel 20Mhz oscilloscope
* One oscilloscope lead
* Facepate layout guide for the scope

## Experiment #2 - Utilizing Emona Trainer Blocks 
The Emona Telecoms-Trainer 101 has a collection of blocks (called modules) that you can put together to implement dozens of communications and telecommunications block together. The trainer is categorized into several functional groups. By connecting these together with banana cords, you build everything from a simple modulation technique to complex digital phase-shift keying systems. The beauty of this system is that it mirrors Mathematical modeling. It's using mathematical equation for the same principle in communication, such as multiplying and adding. 

### Objectives:
* Learn some trainer's analog module
* Know each properties of different module

### Equipment
* Emona Telecom-Trainer 101 (plus power pack)
* Dual channel 20Mhz oscilloscope
* Two Emona Telecom-Trainer 101 oscilloscope leads
* Assorted Emona Telecom-Trainer 101 patch leads
* For 2.1 only - one set of headphones (stereo)
