## Introduction of the Emona Telecoms - Trainer 101
As its name implies, the Emona Telecons-Trainer 101 is used to help students learn about communications and telecommunications principles. It lets you bring to life the block diagrams that fill communications textbooks. A "block diagram" is a simplified representation of a more complex circuit. An example is shown in the Figure below.

The Emona Telecoms-Trainer 101, illustrated below, has a collection of blocks (called modules) that you can put together to implement dozens of communications and telecommunications block diagrams.
